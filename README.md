# junataulu - React Native App in development

Mobile application for checking Finnish train timetables.
I'm training especially these skills while developing this application:
- React Native Expo (esp. Expo's router library)
- Fetching data from API and displaying it
- Managing my project's workflow in GitHub

App's idea is loosely based on existing application, "Juna kulkee", but idea is refined to fit custom needs.
Main idea is to let user to define custom timetables and decide which one is shown on app's index at given time.
Example: a commuter wants index page to show trains from Home Station to Work Station between 7-10 am and vice versa between 3-6 pm.
This feature will be added after basic features are at place (showing train lists by stations, showing single train's timetable...)
